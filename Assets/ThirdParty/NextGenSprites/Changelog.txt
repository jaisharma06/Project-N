1.2.1

+++ Please Note +++
If you come from a previous Version, you may need to delete:
*NextGenSprites//Utils/Helpers/PropertiesCollectionManager.cs
*NextGenSprites//Utils/Helpers/PropertiesCollectionSoloManager.cs

[NEW]
* Added a method to update materials smoothly by a supplied duration to the Properties Collection
  Handler and Controller
  # since this method takes two arguments, you can't set it conveniently on a OnClick action for an
    GUI Button. Instead, you can use "UpdateMaterialByArguments" to parse arguments as strings.
    First comes the collection name and second the duration in seconds separated by a colon e.g.: "Idle:1.35"

[UPDATE]
* Renamed Scripts related to Properties Collection to be more explicit about their purpose
* Some simple custom inspectors for the Properties Collection Remote classes

[FIX]
* Errors when invoking some buttons on the extras Panel from the Material Inspector
* Preferences are now saved per Project and not global
* Several smaller bug fixes on Shaders and Scripts
